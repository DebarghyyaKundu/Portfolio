            <h2>Web Dev Project</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Welcome to Lights, Camera, Review!<br>
              This is my latest Web Development project that I completed. A Movie Review App at its core, this project is a website where the viewers can write thier own takes on the latest movies out there.
              <br>
              Viewers have the option to upload an image and write their reviews which then will be showcased in the website to anybody who accesses the website.
              A fully functional comment section present means other people can comment on any particular review written and express their thoughts on what they think of the review.
              User authentication is also included in the website meaning a review can only be edited or removed by owner of it, and nobody else. The website is super easy to use and very user-friendly.

              <br>
              Coming to the technical side of this project, this app has both front-end and back-end implementations.
              <br>User-authentication, comments section and adding reviews is basically adding information to a database thus being the backend portion of the project while, all the visuals is pure css and javascript.
              Mongo atlas and heroku provide the platform for uploading the database and the app respectively and thus makes it accessable to all users.
              <br>Post routes are triggered by forms used to add comments, accounts (sign up, login) and the reviews themselves.

                <h2>IOT Project</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  Home Automation!
                  <br>This was my IOT workshop completion project which me and my team completed as our 2nd year project. The sole purpose of the project was to automate the electronic devices used in our house,
                  thus reducing the wastage of the electricty used by them. We made a fully functional light bulb which can be operated from our respective mobile phones by use of an app or voice commands.
                  <br>Jumping onto the technical side of the project, the automated bulb for its functionality used a relay, arduino uno and a MCU wifi module.
                  The figure shows the respective circuit required to automate the bulb. By use of the phone app we can simply turn the relay switch on, thus turning the bulb on. The wifi module was connected by any wifi connection and thus all the components are linked. 
                  Google voice commands can be used to do the same.
                  <br>My teammates included Anushka Halder, Ankita Prasad Gupta and Ayusmita Mitra who happen to be my classmates as well. As a collective effort of all of us the project was completed in almost a week's time.
